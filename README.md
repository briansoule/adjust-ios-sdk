## Summary

This is the iOS SDK of Pitchtarget. This SDK is forked from adjust.io™ and it is
designed as a drop-in replacement for such SDK.

You can read more about adjust.io™ at [adjust.io].

## Basic Installation

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the adjust SDK into your
iOS project. We are going to assume that you use Xcode for your iOS
development.

If you're using [CocoaPods][cocoapods], you can add the following line to your
`Podfile` and continue with [step 3](#step3):

```ruby
pod 'Pitchtarget', :git => 'https://bitbucket.org/rocodromo/addictive-ios-sdk/adjust_ios_sdk.git', :tag => 'v2.1.1'
```

### 1. Get the SDK

Clone this repository or generate a zipball. In the latter case, extract the
archive to a folder.

### 2. Add it to your project

In Xcode's Project Navigator locate the `Supporting Files` group (or any other
group of your choice). From Finder drag the `Adjust` subdirectory into
Xcode's `Supporting Files` group.

![][drag]

In the dialog `Choose options for adding these files` make sure to check the
checkbox to `Copy items into destination group's folder` and select the upper
radio button to `Create groups for any added folders`.

![][add]

### 3. Add the AdSupport framework

In the Project Navigator select your project. In the left hand side of the main
view select your target. In the tab `Build Phases` expand the group `Link
Binary with Libraries`. On the bottom of that group click on the `+` button.
Select the `AdSupport.framework` and click the `Add` button. In the list of
frameworks select the newly added `AdSupport.framework` and change the
attribute `Required` to `Optional`.

![][framework]

### 4. Integrate Pitchtarget into your app

In the Project Navigator open the source file your Application Delegate. Add
the `import` statement at the top of the file. In the `didFinishLaunching` or
`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your App Delegate add the following
calls to `Adjust`:

```objc
#import "Adjust.h"
// ...
[Adjust appDidLaunch:@"{YourAppToken}"];
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelInfo];
[Adjust setEnvironment:AIEnvironmentSandbox];
```
![][delegate]

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your App Token that has been given to you.

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see by calling
`setLogLevel:` with one of the following parameters:

```objc
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelVerbose]; // enable all logging
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelDebug];   // enable more logging
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelInfo];    // the default
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelWarn];    // disable info logging
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelError];   // disable warnings as well
[Adjust setLogLevel:AILogLevelAssert];  // disable errors as well
```

Depending on whether or not you build your app for testing or for production
you must call `setEnvironment:` with one of these parameters:

```objc
[Adjust setEnvironment:AIEnvironmentSandbox];
[Adjust setEnvironment:AIEnvironmentProduction];
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `AIEnvironmentSandbox` if and only
if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to
`AIEnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back to
`AIEnvironmentSandbox` when you start testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and artificial
traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value
meaningful at all times! Especially if you are tracking revenue.


### 5. Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you successfully integrated
Pitchtarget into your app. After the app launched, you should see the debug log
`Tracked session start`.

![][run]

#### Troubleshooting

- If your build failed with the error `Adjust requires ARC`, it looks like
  your project is not using [ARC][arc]. In that case we recommend
  [transitioning your project to use ARC][transition]. If you don't want to
  use ARC, you have to enable ARC for all source files of adjust in the
  target's Build Phases:

    Expand the `Compile Sources` group, select all adjust files (AjustIo,
    AI..., ...+AIAdditions, AF..., ...+AFNetworking) and change the `Compiler
    Flags` to `-fobjc-arc` (Select all and press the `Return` key to change
    all at once).

## Additional features

Once you integrated the Pitchtarget SDK into your project, you can take
advantage of the following features.

### 6. Add tracking of custom events.

You can tell Pitchtarget about every event you want. Suppose you want to track
every tap on a button. Just call you event `button_tap`. In your button's
`buttonDown` method you could then add the following line to track the click:

```objc
[Adjust trackEvent:@"button_tap"];
```
You can also append and other custom paramters to any event you track. Just put
some key-value pairs in a dictionary and pass them to the `trackEvent` method.

For example, if you want to send more data about your button tap event, add the
following lines:

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *parameters = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[parameters setObject:@"value" forKey:@"key"];
[parameters setObject:@"bar"   forKey:@"foo"];
[Adjust trackEvent:@"abc123" withParameters:parameters];
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

    http://www.adeven.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}`
that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback this
placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current
device. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only
append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an
event, these parameters won't even be read.

### 7. Add tracking of revenue

If your users can generate revenue by clicking on advertisements or making
in-app purchases you can track those revenues. If, for example, a click is
worth one cent, you could make the following call to track that revenue:

```objc
[Adjust trackRevenue:1.0];
```

The parameter is supposed to be in cents and will get rounded to one decimal
point. If you want to differentiate between different kinds of revenue you can
simply use different event names for each kind. In that case you would make a
call like this:

```objc
[Adjust trackRevenue:1.0 forEvent:@"button_tap"];
```

Again, you can send custom parameters as you would do with normal events.

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *parameters = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[parameters setObject:@"value" forKey:@"key"];
[parameters setObject:@"bar"   forKey:@"foo"];
[Adjust trackRevenue:1.0 forEvent:@"button_tap" withParameters:parameters];
```

If you want to track In-App Purchases, please make sure to call `trackRevenue`
after `finishTransaction` in `paymentQueue:updatedTransaction` only if the
state changed to `SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased`:

```objc
- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions {
    for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions) {
        switch (transaction.transactionState) {
            case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:
                [self finishTransaction:transaction];
                [Adjust trackRevenue:...];
                break;
            // more cases
        }
    }
}
```

### 8. Receive delegate callbacks

Every time your app tries to track a session, an event or some revenue, you can
be notified about the success of that operation and receive additional
information about the current install. Follow these steps to implement the
optional delegate protocol in your app delegate.

1. Open `AppDelegate.h` and add the `Adjust.h` import and the `AdjustDelegate`
   declaration.

    ```objc
    #import "Adjust.h"

    @interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, AdjustDelegate>
    ```

2. Open `AppDelegate.m` and set the adjust delegate in `didFinishLaunching`
   where you already set the adjust environment.

    ```objc
    [Adjust setEnvironment:AIEnvironmentSandbox];
    [Adjust setDelegate:self];
    ```

3. Still in `AppDelegate.m` add the following delegate callback function to
   your app delegate implementation.

    ```objc
    - (void)adjustFinishedTrackingWithResponse:(AIResponseData *)responseData {
    }
    ```

4. Implement the delegate function.

The delegate function will get called every time any activity was tracked or
failed to track. Within the delegate function you have access to the
`responseData` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its attributes:

- `AIActivityKind activityKind` indicates what kind of activity
  was tracked. It has one of these values:

    ```
    AIActivityKindSession
    AIActivityKindEvent
    AIActivityKindRevenue
    ```

- `NSString activityKindString` human readable version of the activity kind. Possible values:

    ```
    session
    event
    revenue
    ```

- `BOOL success` indicates whether or not the tracking attempt was
  successful.
- `BOOL willRetry` is true when the request failed, but will be
  retried.
- `NSString error` an error message when the activity failed to track or
  the response could not be parsed. Is `nil` otherwise.
- `NSString trackerToken` the tracker token of the current install. Is `nil` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.
- `NSString trackerName` the tracker name of the current install. Is `nil` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.

### 9. Enable event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some
HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable
event buffering by adding the following line after your `setEnvironment:` call
in the `didFinishLaunching` method of your Application Delegate:

```objc
[Adjust setEventBufferingEnabled:YES];
```
